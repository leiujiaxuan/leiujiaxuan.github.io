            <p class="title-reverse"> 2. St. Paul's Hill & Church </p>
            <p class="text-reverse"> St. Paul's Hill, also known as Bukit St. Paul, it was originally called 
                Malacca Hill during the Sultanate period and later renamed Mary's Hill by the Portuguese. It was subsequently renamed St. Paul's Hill 
                by the Dutch in honor of the church at its summit. 
                At the summit, you'll find the ruins of St. Paul's Church, one of the oldest European church structure in Southeast Asia, built in 1521.
                Outside the church, there is a big white statue of St. Francis Xavier, a Catholic missionary from Spain who traveled across Asia to spread Christianity. 
                The reason for the statueâ€™s missing right hand remains unknown to this day.
                nside the church, you can find an open grave that originally held the remains of St. Francis Xavier after his death in 1552, 
                though his body was later transferred to Goa, India.</p>

            <p class="title"> 3. A Famosa</p>
            <p class="text"> A Famosa, meaning "The Famous" in Portuguese, is one of Melaka's most iconic historical landmarks. 
                Built in 1511 by the Portuguese, it was originally a massive fortress designed to protect their settlement and control trade routes 
                through the Straits of Malacca. Today, only the Porta de Santiago gate remains, offering a glimpse into its grand past.
                Around A Famosa, you might come across street performers, such as someone posing as a golden statue.
