        <p>Kellie’s Castle, located near Batu Gajah in Perak, Malaysia, is a fascinating structure with a mysterious and romantic past. Built by Scottish planter William Kellie Smith in the early 20th century, the castle was meant to be a symbol of love and prosperity. Intended as a gift for his beloved wife and a luxurious home for his family, the castle’s construction was halted after Smith’s untimely death, leaving the grand vision forever unfinished.</p>

        <p>The architecture of Kellie’s Castle reflects a mix of Scottish, Moorish, and Indian influences, which was quite rare for that time in Malaya. Its grand arches, hidden stairways, and imported bricks and tiles from India show the ambition behind its construction. One of its most notable planned features was the first elevator in Malaysia, a symbol of modern luxury at the time.​</p>
